# Spotipy_dataRetrieval
Getting Data from Spotify Web interface and exploratory analysis

Playing around with the Spotipy API data retrieval.
In this project, I have requested permission by creating credentials for Spotify top hits data.

I've tried to find some correlation with any of the metrics that they create for any particular favorite song to see if anything stands out as to why a song is popular.
Unfortunately, I could not find anything.

However, there was an interesting finding of a correlation of energy to loudness.
Maybe that is why my workout playlist has heavy bass and loud rock songs only.
